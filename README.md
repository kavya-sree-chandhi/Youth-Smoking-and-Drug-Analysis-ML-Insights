## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:
   - Click on the link to the notebook: [Youth Smoking and Drug Analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ldzXAqUi5D9zAbZjJVHobEQIHJOvzK4X)

2. Download the csv file provided.

2. If you need to load the dataset, upload it to Colab or specify the path to the dataset in your Google Drive.

3. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is named `youth_smoking_drug_data.csv`. It contains the following columns:

- `Year`
- `Age_Group`
- `Gender`
- `Smoking_Prevalence`
- `Drug_Experimentation`
- `Socioeconomic_Status`
- `Peer_Influence`
- `School_Programs`
- `Family_Background`
- `Mental_Health`
- `Access_to_Counseling`
- `Parental_Supervision`
- `Substance_Education`
- `Community_Support`
- `Media_Influence`

## Analysis

The analysis includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Missing value and duplicate checks
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Univariate and bivariate analysis
- Visualization of trends

## Machine Learning Models

Various machine learning models are implemented to predict smoking prevalence and drug experimentation, including:

- Random Forest Regressor
- Linear Regression

## Results

The results of the analysis and predictions are visualized using plots and interpreted to provide insights into youth smoking and drug use patterns.
